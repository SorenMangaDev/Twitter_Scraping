I have Twitter feed data in CSV format with columns: username, text, timestamp, has_images, number_of_images, has_video, replies, retweets, and likes. Please perform a quantitative analysis focusing on these specific metrics:

Political Content Distribution:Categorize each tweet as either left-leaning, right-leaning, or neutral
Calculate the exact ratio of left vs right political content

For political tweets, identify the top engaged accounts
